# Restaurant Menu System with Flask Backend

A simple restaurant menu system built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend), and Flask (backend). This system allows customers to view the menu, place orders, modify the order (add/remove items), and confirm their orders. It uses Flask as a backend server to handle menu data and orders, with a JSON-based data source.

## Features

- **Menu Display**: View a list of menu items (name, price, and ID).
- **Order Placement**: Place orders by selecting items from the menu using their IDs.
- **Order Modification**: Add or remove items from an order before confirming.
- **Order Confirmation**: Confirm the order and receive a thank you message with the total amount.
